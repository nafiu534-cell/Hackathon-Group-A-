# Hackathon-Group-A-
This project explores relationships between various marketing channels and sales performance using Python-based data analysis techniques. The analysis focuses on understanding how different marketing mediums (TV advertising, Radio, Social Media, and Influencer marketing) correlate with sales outcomes through visualization and statistical analysis.
Dataset

**The dataset (marketing_sales_data.csv) contains 572 entries with 5 columns:**

TV (categorical): Advertising spend level (Low, Medium, High)
Radio (numerical): Radio advertising investment
Social Media (numerical): Social media marketing investment
Influencer (categorical): Type of influencer used (Micro, Mega, Nano, Macro)
Sales (numerical): Resulting sales figures

**Methodology:**

**The analysis utilized the following Python libraries:**

pandas for data manipulation and analysis
numpy for numerical operations
matplotlib for visualization
seaborn for enhanced visualizations
scikit-learn for preprocessing categorical data

The categorical variable 'Influencer' was encoded using a Label Encoder (Micro → 2, Mega → 1, Nano → 3, Macro → 0) to facilitate numerical analysis.

**Key Findings**

**Data Distribution:**

Sales data shows a relatively normal distribution with some positive skewness
The Radio advertising investment displays a moderate positive skew
Most investments are concentrated in the mid-range, with fewer instances of extremely high or low spending

**Relationship Analysis:**

The scatter plot between Sales and Social Media shows a weak positive correlation, indicating that higher social media spending tends to correlate with increased sales, but the relationship isn't strongly linear
Radio advertising shows a stronger positive correlation with sales compared to social media
The data distribution suggests that a multi-channel marketing approach yields better sales results than single-channel focus
